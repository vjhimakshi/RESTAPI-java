Given a country name and a phone number, query the API at https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/countries?name=country to get the country's calling codes. Prepend the calling code to the phone number and return the string. If the data array is empty, return the string -1. If there are multiple calling codes, use the one at the highest index.
